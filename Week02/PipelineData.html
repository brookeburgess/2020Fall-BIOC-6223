<h2> Sample Virus Pipeline</h2>
  <p>The following is a condensed example that might be taken from a methods section.
  <p>Note that a "dict" file will have a mediatype of "application/octet-stream" (the default value). Others are easy to find.

<br>
   <table style="width:900px">
    <tr>
      <td>
        All data is stored on a <a href="https://hive2.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=login">HIVE instance on a linux server</a>. Starting with <a href="https://hive2.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=objFile&ids=14778">read file 1</a> and <a href="https://hive2.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=objFile&ids=14775">reference file 2</a>, align the input file 1 to input file 2 using the Hexagon tool, using a minimum match length of 75, and allowing for 15 percent mismatches. This will produce several files. Take the <a href="https://hive2.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=objFile&ids=14781">alignment file</a> and use Heptagon to call SNPs, setting "collapseRpts" to "false," "cutEnds" to "do not cut," and "supportedDeletions" to "true." Heptagon produces three files, all_indels.dict, FreqProfile.csv, and SNPprofile. All of the files are appended to the base URL https://hive2.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=objFile&ids=14782&filename=all_indels.dict.
